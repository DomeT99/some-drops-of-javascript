# System
In this chapter, we will explore how to interact with system-level functionalities using JavaScript. While JavaScript is often associated with front-end development, it can also be a powerful tool for retrieving and managing system information, especially in server-side environments. JavaScript provides several built-in modules that allow us to access vital details about the underlying system, offering a deeper understanding of the environment where the code is running.

This chapter will introduce key functions and techniques to help you access critical system information, such as:

- **Operating System Information:** Learn how to retrieve details like the operating system version, platform type, architecture, and uptime. This is useful for cross-platform applications where behavior may vary depending on the environment.
- **Environment Variables:** Discover how to access and manipulate environment variables, which are often used for configuration purposes in development, staging, and production environments.
- **Memory and CPU Usage:** We'll look into monitoring system resource consumption, including memory and CPU usage, to help optimize performance and detect potential bottlenecks or issues.
- **User and Process Information:** Find out how to gather data about the current user, home directory, system processes, and more. This is particularly valuable in user-centric or process-driven applications.

By the end of this chapter, you'll have the tools to write JavaScript code that effectively interacts with the system, enhancing your ability to monitor, debug, and optimize your applications. Whether you are building a desktop tool, a server-side script, or need to gain insights into your deployment environment, this chapter will give you a solid foundation for handling system-related tasks using JavaScript.
